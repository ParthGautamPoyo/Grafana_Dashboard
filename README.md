### Dataset Features  
- **Volume**: 256,229 rows.  
- **Missing Values**: Some columns like `make`, `model`, `trim`, `body`, `transmission`, etc., have missing values.  
- **Format**: CSV.  

# Data Ingestion Process
The data ingestion process was carefully designed to handle the large dataset and transform it into a time-series format suitable for InfluxDB. Below are the steps in detail:

**Step 1**: Data Preprocessing
**Header Standardization:**
Column names were cleaned and converted to lowercase without spaces (e.g., Rainfall_mm â†’ rainfall_mm).
**Feature Categorization:**
**Numerical Features:** year, condition, odometer, mmr, sellingprice.  
**Categorical Features:** make, model, trim, body, transmission, vin, state, color, seller.
**Datetime Formatting:**
Timestamps were generated for every row to align the dataset with InfluxDB's time-series requirements.
**Step 2:** Transformation to Line Protocol
InfluxDB requires data in a specific format called line protocol. A Python script (convertToinflux.py) was used to:

Convert each row into the format:
measurement,tag_key=tag_value field_key=field_value timestamp

This transformation ensured that numerical values were stored as fields, while categorical values were stored as tags.

**Step 3:** Loading into InfluxDB
**Telegraf Configuration:**
Telegraf was configured to read the transformed data file.
A custom configuration file (telegraf.conf) defined the input and output plugins.
**Data Validation:**
After ingestion, sample queries were run in InfluxDB to verify the data integrity.
